Installing Ploneboard

  To install Ploneboard, uncompress the product into
  your zope/Products directory or link it there, e.g.::

    ln -s /path/to/installation /path/to/zope/Products

  In the root of your Plone site (within the ZMI):

      1.  Add an external method to the root of the Plone site.

      2.  Use the following configuration values for the external
          method:

          o id: install_ploneboard

          o title: Install Ploneboard *optional*

          o module name: Ploneboard.Install

          o function name: install

      3. Go to the management screen for the newly added external
         method and click the 'Test' tab.  

The manager should now be able to instantiate a Ploneboard from 
within Plone.

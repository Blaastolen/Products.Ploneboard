PloneBoard to-do list

=================
Package structure
=================

- Rename 'types' directory to 'content' or similar, to enable use of python
    types (StringType etc.) in the root dir

- Split up posting macros, as entire template is evaluated each time a macro is
    used

- Ensure conversations end up in portal_catalog

======================
Workflows and Security
======================

- Add more security declarations, use the board permissions.

- Getting "not allowed to access getBoardTitle in this context" when trying to
    use getBoardTitle in board_header

- Various permission bugs (possibly fixed, need testing):

    - One private forum in a board makes the whole board private (anon is 
        prompted for login)
    
    - No difference between freeforall and memberposting - anon can't post in 
        either
    
    - anon or member can't view a moderated forum
    
    - reviewer can view moderation-form but doesn't see action buttons to 
        publish
    
    - if you reject a moderated post, it vanishes from the plone UI
    
    - as soon as a moderated forum contains a comment that was published, anon 
        and member lose viewing rights 
    
      - Unauthorized - access to 'Creator' denied
      
    - No links to moderation-form or folder_contents (to delete a forum)
    
    - Can't edit posted comment (actually a feature, make sure it works if you 
        change permissions)
    
    - A forum starts in 'freeforall' but if it's moderated or memberposting and 
        you want to send it back, the action says 'anarchy'.

================
Template changes
================

- Enable threaded view, perhaps with TemplateMixin on board?

- Create a single page showing all threads in a board, with all replies in a
    tree view

- "Up to" in board_header should list the name of the object above + type, like
    "Back to developer forum"

- Rename forum_view -> conversation_listing - it's actually a listing, not a
    view

- When creating a forum, it says unknown date (because forum date is last 
    posting date), display something like 'no conversations' instead

============
i18n support
============

- Ensure i18n keys are used everywhere

===========================
Discussion tool integration
===========================

- Should be able to use Ploneboard for discussion on content items

- Should have an aggregate page which shows all discussions going on in the
    portal

=====
Tests
=====

- Refactor tests, use PloneTestCase

===================
Future/nice-to-have
===================

- Mail/news gateway (bye-bye gmane?)

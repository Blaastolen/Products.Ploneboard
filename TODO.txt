Ploneboard to-do list
=====================

    Code structure
    --------------

    - Split up posting macros, as entire template is evaluated each time a 
        macro is used.

    - Ensure conversations end up in portal_catalog.
        - Can use ArchetypeTool's catalog multiplex for this
        
    Workflows and Security
    ----------------------

    - Unit tests for security and workflows!!!!!!1111
      Without tests, changes are mostly worthless.

    - Add more security declarations, use the board permissions everywhere.

    - Various permission bugs (possibly fixed, need testing):

        - reviewer can view moderation-form but doesn't see action buttons to 
            publish
    
        - if you reject a moderated post, it vanishes from the plone UI
    
        - Can't edit posted comment (actually a feature, make sure it works 
            if you change permissions)
    
    UI fixes
    --------

    - Rename forum_view -> conversation_listing - it's actually a listing, not a
        view
    
    - Need indication in UI when threads are locked or sticky
      HOWEVER
      Sticky is _not_ implemented using workflow states. Alternatives include reference etc.

    - Implement comment moderation

    - Get kupu to load everywhere

        - Set kupu as default editor sitewide?
          Alternatively always call kupu

        - portal_javascript calls kupu tool with allowAnonymous=False (default behaviour)
          Change condition on kupu javascripts?
          Add entries for kupu javascripts when used for board?


    Discussion tool integration
    ----------------------------

    - Should have an aggregate page which shows all discussions going on in the
        portal

    Tests
    ------

    - Refactor tests, use PloneTestCase

    Future/nice-to-have
    -------------------

    - Mail/news gateway (bye-bye gmane?)
